# Glossary Go Definitions

This directory holds copy/paste Go definitions used to build implementation slices.
Files are intentionally non-compiling and optimized for extracting single structures/functions.

## Conventions

- Envelope type names use `*Env` suffix (`CommandEnv`, `EventEnv`, etc.).
- Imports are intentionally omitted when inferable.
- Definitions are split into small code blocks for selective copy/paste.

## Active Slices

- `transport.md`
- `frame.md`
- `tlv_codec.md` (stub)
- `semantic_validation.md` (stub)
- `mirage_reconcile.md` (stub)
- `ghost_dispatch.md` (stub)
- `observability.md` (stub)
- `../progress/index.md` (status tracker)
