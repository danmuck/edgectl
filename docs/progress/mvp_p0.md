# MVP Progress — Phase 0 (Contract Freeze)

Status: `Done`

### Tasks

- [x] Lock canonical vocabulary: `issue`, `command`, `seed.execute`, `seed.result`, `event`, `report`
- [x] Lock authority model: Mirage = desired/observed, Ghost = execution, Seed = service interface
- [x] Lock required envelope fields and message type IDs
- [x] Define exact “done” behavior for one full intent lifecycle

### Acceptance Checks

- [x] `design.toml` and `protocol.toml` use identical terminology
- [x] No ambiguous command/event naming remains
- [x] Envelope names and required fields are final
