# MVP Progress — Phase 6 (Boundary Transport Integration)

Status: `Not Started`

### Tasks

- [ ] Bind control-plane links to protocol envelopes (not ad-hoc calls)
- [ ] Replace any direct action-style HTTP shortcuts between Mirage and Ghost
- [ ] Wire optional auth block handling and validation hooks
- [ ] Add contract tests for all boundaries

### Acceptance Checks

- [ ] All boundary interactions are envelope-driven
- [ ] Protocol encode/decode is used end-to-end across boundaries
