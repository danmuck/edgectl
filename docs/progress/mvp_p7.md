# MVP Progress — Phase 7 (End-to-End Control Loop)

Status: `In Progress`

### Tasks

- [x] Add deterministic E2E scenario: store file intent on one `seed.fs` ghost, then copy intent to all `seed.fs` ghosts (`internal/mirage/orchestration_test.go`)
- [ ] Add deterministic logs for ownership transitions
- [ ] Add E2E failure scenario with corrective behavior

### Acceptance Checks

- [ ] Success and failure loop tests both pass
- [ ] Ownership transitions are visible and unambiguous
